		 MANCALA GAME PLAYING AGENT

What is it ?
------------

This is an AI agent which plays the game of Mancala. There are three functionalities - 

1) Greedy Approach - Tells you the immediate best step 

2) Minimax Approach - Tells you the next best step for a certain depth. Depth here is the total number of turns played. So if depth is 2, that means both players play 1 turn each.

3) Alpha Beta Pruning - Does the above approach in a more efficient way(does not open all its children).
